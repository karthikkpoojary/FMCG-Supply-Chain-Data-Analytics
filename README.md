## 🚀 Project Overview

This project delivers a **complete FMCG Supply Chain Analytics solution**, designed to replicate how **real-world supply chain analysts** work in consumer goods companies.

The analysis focuses on:
- 📦 Inventory optimization
- 📈 Demand forecasting accuracy
- 🚚 Logistics & delivery performance
- 🛒 Order fulfillment efficiency

The project combines **Python analytics**, **Power BI dashboards**, and a **Streamlit web app** to support **data-driven supply chain decisions**.


## 🎯 Business Problem

FMCG companies often face challenges such as:
- Frequent **stockouts**
- Excess **inventory holding cost**
- Inaccurate **demand forecasts**
- **Delivery delays** impacting service levels


## 🚩 Objective
Analyze supply chain data to identify demand–supply gaps, optimize inventory levels, and improve delivery performance using data analytics.


## 🧠 Key Business Questions Answered

- Which products and warehouses face frequent stockouts?
- Are we overstocking slow-moving products?
- How accurate is demand forecasting?
- Which products experience higher delivery delays?
- When should we reorder inventory to avoid stockouts?


## 📊 KPIs Analyzed

### 📦 Inventory KPIs
- Inventory Level
- Stockout Days
- Inventory Turnover
- Days of Inventory

### 📈 Demand & Forecast KPIs
- Forecast vs Actual Demand
- Forecast Error
- Demand Variability

### 🚚 Logistics KPIs
- Lead Time
- Delivery Delay
- Order Fulfillment Indicators


## 🗂️ Dataset Description

The project uses **four core tables**, designed like a real enterprise data model:

| Table | Description |
|-----|------------|
| `products.csv` | Product master data |
| `inventory.csv` | Daily stock levels by warehouse |
| `orders.csv` | Customer orders & delivery details |
| `demand_forecast.csv` | Forecasted vs actual demand |

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard contains **four business-focused pages**:

1. **Executive Overview** – High-level KPIs & stockout risk  
2. **Inventory Analysis** – Overstock vs understock detection  
3. **Demand vs Supply** – Forecast accuracy evaluation  
4. **Logistics Performance** – Lead time & delivery analysis  

📌 Designed for **senior management and operations teams**.


## 🌐 Streamlit Application

An interactive **Streamlit web app** enables:
- Product & warehouse filtering
- Stockout risk monitoring
- Forecast vs actual comparison
- Delivery performance analysis

This demonstrates **analytics + application development skills**.


## 📌 Key Insights

- Certain FMCG products face **frequent stockouts**, risking lost sales.
- Slow-moving products are **overstocked**, increasing holding cost.
- Forecast inaccuracies directly impact inventory availability.
- Delivery lead-time variability worsens replenishment delays.


## ✅ Recommendations

- Implement **Reorder Point & Safety Stock** logic for high-risk products.
- Improve forecasting for high-variability items.
- Reduce inventory for slow-moving SKUs.
- Monitor logistics KPIs continuously using dashboards.


## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Supply Chain Analytics (FMCG)
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Demand Forecasting (Moving Average, Regression)
- Inventory Optimization (ROP & Safety Stock)
- Power BI Dashboarding
- Streamlit App Development
- Business Insight & Storytelling
